abstract="The western Himalayan forests have frequent forest fire that affect its forest wealth, biodiversity, ecology and environment. Ironically, there is a scarcity of a comprehensive and systematic effort to know its fire-sensitive forest regions. Therefore, the present study was carried out in Kangra region of Indian western Himalaya to identify suitable conditions for forest fire by overlaying geographical coordinates of recorded fire locations on various thematic layers such as elevation, slope, aspect, mean annual temperature and fuel map of the region. Based on suitability table, the regions with favourable fire conditions were extracted from above thematic layers in GIS environment. The fire-sensitive regions were further prioritized into very high, high, medium, low, and very low forest fire-prone areas. The Pinus roxburghii forest type, low elevation, high temperature, high slope, south-west facing aspect, May month and anthropogenic disturbances were identified as major factors responsible for forest fire in the region. The half of the forest cover was identified as fire sensitive. The 10.7 {\%} of the forest cover in the study area was categorized as `very high' and `high' forest fire-prone areas. The 14.02 {\%} villages of the region were identified as `high' forest fire prone. The P. roxburghii, mixed forest species, khair forest (Acacia spp.) and oak forest (Quercus spp.) were identified as fire-sensitive forest types of the region.",

	abstract="Shepherding in the Western Himalayan region of Himachal Pradesh (India) was carried out primarily by agro-pastoralist. They were an integral part of the socio-economic system of precolonial Himalayan states. Due to environmental and social factors, varied pastoral practices had evolved historically in different parts of Himachal. The establishment of British rule in India represented a fundamental break from the past. Colonial interests now dominated, and pastoral practices were restricted and altered in response to the newly introduced forest laws.",

	abstract="This article demonstrates that a growing number of Tibetans aspire to migrate to the West and that their `capital' in India, Dharamsala, has become a place of various on-migration activities for the Tibetan newcomers who have relatively recently arrived to India. The case is connected with the current academic discussion on on-migration, a task that has not been fulfilled in the context of this locality before. The study is done by qualitative ethnographic methods, examining migration aspirations of the Tibetan newcomers and their flow out of Dharamsala particularly through heterogeneous refugee narratives and the statements of the Tibetan settlement officials. There is no single motive behind the on-migration aspirations of the Tibetan newcomers, but the interviewees highlighted their livelihood-related difficulties, although increased freedoms in India compared with Tibet under the Chinese rule were appreciated. Hence, global socio-economic and political inequalities affect the migration patterns of the Tibetan newcomers.",

	abstract="The present work was conducted to assess the regeneration pattern of dominant tree species in the forested landscapes of Himachal Pradesh, India. The study was conducted in four agro-climatic zones viz., zone I, zone II, zone III and zone IV, of the state at 58 locations during 2002--2007. Stratified random quadrat sampling was employed to estimate regeneration pattern of tree species by classifying them into seedling, sapling and adult stages. The analysis of data was carried out using MS excel while it was spatially represented in Geographic Information System environment. The regeneration pattern was divided in to four classes namely good, fair, poor and no regeneration. A total of 23 forest landscape elements (LSEs) dominated by 18 tree species were observed at the surveyed localities. These tree species are representative of the western Himalayan ecosystem. The number of seedlings, saplings and adults ranged from 0 to 2,700/ha, 0 to 1,500/ha, and 20 to 1,470/ha, respectively in different LSEs. Picea smithiana was observed to posses highest number of seedlings (2,700/ha) and saplings (1,500/ha) in zone IV and zone III, respectively. Cedrus deodara, on the other hand, had the maximum number of adults (1,470/ha) in its pure patch in Shimla in zone III. The results showed that amongst the four agro-climatic zones, the zone I in general had a trend of poor to no regeneration while other zones generally had fair regeneration. Zone I and zone II had poor, fair and no regeneration pattern. The trees in zone III and zone IV had good regeneration pattern in addition to poor, fair and no regeneration. Based on the results of present study, it is suggested that efficient measures are needed to conserve and to increase the tree regeneration growth in zone I of the state, whereas special efforts should be made to maintain the luxuriant forest status in rest of the agro-climatic zones of Himachal Pradesh.",

The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund {\&} R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148--156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.",

	abstract="Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) causes one of the most economically important diseases in cattle, and the virus is found worldwide. A better understanding of the disease associated factors is a crucial step towards the definition of strategies for control and eradication. In this study we trained a random forest (RF) prediction model and performed variable importance analysis to identify factors associated with BVDV occurrence. In addition, we assessed the influence of features selection on RF performance and evaluated its predictive power relative to other popular classifiers and to logistic regression. We found that RF classification model resulted in an average error rate of 32.03{\%} for the negative class (negative for BVDV) and 36.78{\%} for the positive class (positive for BVDV).The RF model presented area under the ROC curve equal to 0.702. Variable importance analysis revealed that important predictors of BVDV occurrence were: a) who inseminates the animals, b) number of neighboring farms that have cattle and c) rectal palpation performed routinely. Our results suggest that the use of machine learning algorithms, especially RF, is a promising methodology for the analysis of cross-sectional studies, presenting a satisfactory predictive power and the ability to identify predictors that represent potential risk factors for BVDV investigation. We examined classical predictors and found some new and hard to control practices that may lead to the spread of this disease within and among farms, mainly regarding poor or neglected reproduction management, which should be considered for disease control and eradication.",

	ABSTRACT = {Abstract: This paper discusses the pre-launch spectral characterization of the Operational Land Imager (OLI) at the component, assembly and instrument levels and relates results of those measurements to artifacts observed in the on-orbit imagery. It concludes that the types of artifacts observed and their magnitudes are consistent with the results of the  pre-launch characterizations. The OLI in-band response was characterized both at the integrated instrument level for a sampling of detectors and by an analytical stack-up of component measurements. The out-of-band response was characterized using a combination of Focal Plane Module (FPM) level measurements and optical component level measurements due to better sensitivity. One of the challenges of a pushbroom design is to match the spectral responses for all detectors so that images can be flat-fielded regardless of the spectral nature of the targets in the imagery. Spectral variability can induce striping (detector-to-detector variation), banding (FPM-to-FPM variation) and other artifacts in the final data products. Analyses of the measured spectral response showed that the maximum discontinuity between FPMs due to spectral filter differences is 0.35% for selected targets for all bands except for Cirrus, where there is almost no signal. The average discontinuity between FPMs is 0.12% for the same targets. These results were expected and are in accordance with the OLI requirements. Pre-launch testing identified low levels (within requirements) of spectral crosstalk amongst the three HgCdTe (Cirrus, SWIR1 and SWIR2) bands of the OLI and on-orbit data confirms this crosstalk in the imagery. Further post-launch analyses and simulations revealed that the strongest crosstalk effect is from the SWIR1 band to the Cirrus band; about 0.2% of SWIR1 signal leaks into the Cirrus. Though the total crosstalk signal is only a few counts, it is evident in some scenes when the in-band cirrus signal is very weak. In moist cirrus-free atmospheres and over typical land surfaces, at least 30% of the cirrus signal was due to the SWIR1 band. In the SWIR1 and SWIR2 bands, crosstalk accounts for no more than 0.15% of the total signal.},
