Within the last centuries, the world has seen a significant transition in land-use activities. Large areas of natural forests have been converted into plantations, pastures and urban areas to provide resources for human beings. This has led to a significant loss in vegetation cover worldwide and serious environmental impacts; such as a loss of biodiversity and increase in greenhouse gas emissions. Similar losses in vegetation cover have affected the north Indian state of Himachal Pradesh, which is known to be one of the most ecologically rich states in the country.

\justify
The study area, Dharamshala Tehsil region, is located in the Indian state of Himachal Pradesh. Within the last decade, there has been an emergence of significant illegal logging and mining in the study area; as implied by various anecdotal sources. However, there is a lack of publicly accessible vegetation cover data to verify or quantify this evidence. Furthermore, there is also a lack of publicly accessible and spatially/temporally relevant auxiliary data from Indian-based and external organizations for us to investigate further. This study proposes an alternative vegetation monitoring strategy which enables effective spatio-temporal analysis of vegetation cover in the study area. The end goal of this study is to identify sub-regions in the study area from 2013-2017 which underwent significant vegetation loss. This information would be passed on to relevant authorities for further investigation.

\justify
In this study, remote sensing datasets were queried and Landsat 8 Surface Reflectance data was identified to be the most suitable for analysis. Image classification algorithms were queried and the random forests algorithm was identified as an effective supervised classifier. Field work was conducted to acquire field data of pre-defined vegetation classes; which would later be used for supervised classification. Supervised classification was then conducted to obtain 26 vegetation classification images of the study area. These images were then grouped and analyzed using a raster time-series framework and the Mann-Whitney $U$ test. With this, the study was able to identify vegetated sub-regions in the period of 2013-2017 which had undergone significant vegetation cover loss.

\justify
Despite certain limitations in the vegetation cover loss analysis, the proposed vegetation monitoring strategy in this study was deemed to be viable and effective in conducting spatio-temporal analyses of vegetation cover in the study area.
